# vre-prototyping
This Unity project serves as a prototyping tool for blocking out basic interactions for a VR Editor. Nothing is functional, but it provides a good 'feel' gut check on whether tool and menu layout and controller arrangements are working effectively. Currently using VRTK for basic interactivity.
